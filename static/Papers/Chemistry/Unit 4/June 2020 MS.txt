Section A (multiple choice)  1 The only correct answer is C (quenching and titrating with acid) A is incorrect because bromine is coloured B is incorrect because ions are produced during the reaction D is incorrect because carbon dioxide is a gas produced in the reaction (1)  2 The only correct answer is B (0 2) A is incorrect because experiments 1 and 2 show the order for Z is 2 C is incorrect because in experiments 3 and 2 doubling the concentration of Y results in no change in the rate, so Y is order 0 D is incorrect because in experiments 1 and 3 doubling the concentration of Z results in 4x the rate, so halving the concentration of Y makes no difference to rate so is order 0 (1)  3 The only correct answer is B (460 mins) A is incorrect because this value would be misreading the scale of the graph C is incorrect because this is the time to get half way to the final concentration on the graph D is incorrect because this is half the time of the reaction on the graph (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
  4 (a) The only correct answer is A (the units for the rate constant are dm3 mol‚Äì1 s‚Äí1) B is incorrect because the reaction is second order overall C is not correct because the units of rate are always mol dm -3 s-1 D is not correct because the rate would double as iodine is zero order (1)  4 (b) The only correct answer is D (the rate is unchanged when the hydrogen ion concentration is doubled) A is incorrect because the rate of reaction does increase with temperature B is incorrect because the rate constant depends on the temperature and increases as temperature rises C is not correct because sodium hydroxide would neutralise some of the [H +] catalyst so change rate (1)  5 The only correct answer is D (2-bromo-2-methylpropane) A is incorrect because this is a primary bromoalkane and RBr is most likely to be tertiary B is incorrect because this is a secondary bromoalkane and RBr is most likely to be tertiary C is incorrect because this is a primary bromoalkane and RBr is most likely to be tertiary (1) -----End of Page: 2-----
  6 The only correct answer is B (ŒîSsurroundings is positive) A is incorrect because ŒîH is negative for an exothermic reaction C is incorrect because ŒîSsystem is positive as a gas is being formed D is incorrect because as both ŒîSsystem and ŒîSsurroundings are positive so ŒîStotal will be positive (1)  7 The only correct answer is A ( Kc = (Kc ·á±)2) B is incorrect because this is not true as ùêæ‡Øñ ·á± must be squared C is incorrect because this is not true as ùêæ‡Øñ ·á± must be squared not multiplied by 2 D is incorrect because this is not true as ùêæ‡Øñ ·á± must be squared not square rooted (1)  8 The only correct answer is B (447) A is incorrect because this answer assumes the concentration of ethanoate ion = concentration of hydrogen ion (as it would be in a weak acid calculation) C is incorrect because this answer is ‚Äì logKa so does not consider the concentrations D is incorrect because this answer is ‚Äìlog(2xKa) which has the concentrations upside down (1) -----End of Page: 3-----

  11 The only correct answer is B (CHI3) A is incorrect because there should be 3I not 3H attached to the C C is incorrect because this is the product of the reaction between iodine and propanone in acidic conditions D is incorrect because this is an intermediate during the reaction between iodine and propanone (1)  12 The only correct answer is C (CH3CONH2) A is incorrect because this is formed by the initial reaction between the two B is incorrect because this is formed by the reaction between HCl and methylamine D is incorrect because this is the organic product of the reaction between the two (1)  13 The only correct answer is C (Ethyl ethanoate, CH3COOCH2CH3) A is incorrect because this has a percentage of 40% B is incorrect because this is isomeric to D so cannot be the answer D is incorrect because this is isomeric to B so cannot be the answer (1) -----End of Page: 6-----
