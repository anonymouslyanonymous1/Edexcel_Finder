  12 The only correct answer is C (tertiary only) A is not correct because primary bromoalkanes react by an SN2 mechanism and the product would be optically active B is not correct because secondary bromoalkanes react by an SN1 or an SN2 mechanism and the product could be optically active D is not correct because primary and secondary bromoalkanes react by SN1 and SN2 mechanisms and the products could be optically active (1)  13 The only correct answer is D A is not correct because this is an aldehyde and it would give a silver mirror with Tollens’ reagent B is not correct because this is an aldehyde and it would give a silver mirror with Tollens’ reagent C is not correct because this is an aldeh yde and it would give a silver mirror with Tollens’ reagent (1)  14 The only correct answer is C ( CH3COONa and CH3CH2CH2OH) A is not correct because ethanoic acid reacts with NaOH to form the sodium salt B is not correct because ethanoic acid reacts with NaOH to form the sodium salt and propan-1-ol does not react with NaOH D is not correct because propan-1-ol does not react with NaOH (1) -----End of Page: 6-----
 (Total for Section A = 20 marks)  15 The only correct answer is C (905 %) A is not correct because the molar masses have been used for the incorrect substances and the amount of ethanoic acid should be the numerator of the fraction B is not correct because the masses have not been converted into moles and the amount of ethanoic acid should be the numerator of the fraction D is not correct because the masses have not been converted into moles (1)  16 The only correct answer is D (weak attraction to stationary phase, strong attraction to mobile phase) A is not correct because if there was a strong attraction to the stationary phase the component would not move very far and would have a low Rf value B is not correct because if there was a weak attraction to the mobile phase the component would not move very far and would have a low Rf value C is not correct because if there was a weak attraction to the mobile phase the component would not move very far and would have a low Rf value (1) -----End of Page: 7-----

 19(d)* This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully-sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points 6 4 5–4 3 3–2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) (6) -----End of Page: 24-----
 Comment: Look for the indicative marking points first, then consider the mark for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks, and 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 mark for reasoning, and 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would score zero marks for reasoning Additional incorrect chemistry loses a structure and lines of reasoning mark (if 1 or 2 have been awarded) -----End of Page: 25-----
