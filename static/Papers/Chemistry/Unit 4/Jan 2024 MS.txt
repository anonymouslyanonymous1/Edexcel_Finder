  15(a) The only correct answer is A (2-methylpropan-2-ol) B is incorrect because Mr of pentane is 72, and loss of CH3 would give the major ion at m/z = 57 C is incorrect because Mr of propanal is 58, so the major ion cannot be at m/z = 59 D is incorrect because Mr of propanone is 58, so the major ion cannot be at m/z = 59 (1)  15(b) The only correct answer is D (propanone) A is incorrect because there is no peak due to an O-H stretching vibration B is incorrect because pentane spectrum does not have a peak due to a C=O stretching vibration C is incorrect because propanal reacts with acidified aqueous sodium dichromate (1) TOTAL FOR SECTION A = 20 MARKS -----End of Page: 7-----

  *17(b) This question assesses the student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points 6 4 5-4 3 3-2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained lines of reasoning Answer shows a coherent logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, a response with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there were no linkages between the points, then the same indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 reasoning mark 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would get zero reasoning marks If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct mark(s) from the reasoning If no reasoning mark(s) awarded do not deduct mark(s) Comment: Look for the indicative marking points first, then consider the mark for the structure of the answer and sustained line of reasoning (6) -----End of Page: 17-----
