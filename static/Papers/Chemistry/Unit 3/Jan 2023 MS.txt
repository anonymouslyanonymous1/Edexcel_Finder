  the measured concentration of the descaler was almost the same as / slightly less / only ~ 15% less than the stated concentration (1) I f candidates have failed to × 10 then the measured concentration of the descaler is much less ( so it would be much less effective ) If candidates value is very high then concentration of descaler is much greater so might damage the appliance or be unsafe to use in the home  (Total for Question 3 = 1 8 marks) -----End of Page: 9-----
