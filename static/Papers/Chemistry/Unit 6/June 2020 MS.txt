  3(a)  phenol is corrosive and wearing gloves Allow caustic Allow phenol is toxic by skin absorption so wear gloves Ignore irritates the skin Ignore use of fume cupboard Do not award toxic so use fume cupboard and corrosive so use gloves (1)  3(b) An answer that makes reference to the following points:  phenol reacts (rapidly) with the bromine (formed in the reaction)  when all the phenol is used up the (excess)bromine bleaches the methyl red indicator (marking a fixed point in the progress of the reaction) (1) (1) Ignore reference to white precipitate (of 2,4,6-tribromophenol) Allow phenol removes the bromine Do not award phenol is a solvent Allow indicator decolourises when all the phenol has reacted / is used up (2)  3(c)  use a white card / white background Allow any position of the white card (etc) Ignore adding more indicator / increased conc Do not award use of a cross (on white card) Do not award use of a colorimeter (1) -----End of Page: 7-----

  3(d)(ii)  suitable choice of scale and correct choice of axes  axes labelled, with units  all six points plotted correctly and best fit line (through the origin) COMMENT Mark the plotting and BFL by impressio n but points 1,2 5 and 6 should be on the line with 3 slightly above the line and 4 slightly below If the scale is non-linear only M2 is available (1) (1) (1) Points plotted together with the origin (if included but not required) must cover at least 50% of the graph in both directions 1/t on vertical axis Ignore punctuation errors eg (cm 3) instead of / cm3 (3) -----End of Page: 9-----
  3(d)(iii)  first order (with respect to bromate(V) ions) and because the graph ((of 1/t ∝ rate) v volume of BrO3− (∝ concentration)) is a straight line (through the origin) Allow first order (with respect to bromate(V) ions) and because as the concentration / volume (of BrO 3−) doubles, the rate doubles Or because as the concentration / volume (of BrO 3−) doubles, the time halves Ignore rate increases as concentration of BrO 3− increases because rate proportional to concentration of BrO 3− (1) -----End of Page: 10-----
  3(d)(iv)  the methyl red is decolourised early in the reaction when the concentration of reactant vs time graph is (almost) linear so the gradient of the tangent is the same as the (change in) concentration / time Example of possible graph Accept this shown on a sketch graph Allow assumes that the reaction rate is constant for a particular run using conc v time graph as shown on left do not award just ‘concentration is proportional to time’ (1) -----End of Page: 11-----
  3(d)(v) An explanation that makes reference to the following points:  the portion need not be discarded and as the data is plotted on a graph, the actual volume of the BrO3− solution is not important (provided the (accurate) volume is known)  but the volume of water added must change from 70 cm 3 to 65 cm3 (1) (1) Ignore references to experimental uncertainty Allow the portion need not be discarded and if the volume is known or the total volume of the solution must still be kept at 40 cm 3 If no other mark is scored, ‘portion should be discarded and because the total volume will have changed’ scores (1) (2)  3(e)(i)  the burette would transfer the liquid too slowly (so the start time would be inaccurate) Accept reverse arguments Accept if a burette is used the reaction will start before all the KBrO 3 is added Allow if a burette is used the reaction will start immediately so difficult to measure the time (1) -----End of Page: 12-----
  3(e)(ii)  150 cm3 (of the BrO3−) is the largest volume so it will have the lowest (percentage) uncertainty  no water is used so this (volume measurement uncertainty) is eliminated (1) (1) Ignore reference to measurement error Allow just ‘this is the largest volume’ Allow just ‘no water added’ Allow only 3 volumes measured (2)  3(f) An answer that makes reference to the following points:  repeat the experiment for (various concentrations of) Br− ions and (then for) H+ ions  varying volume of each, (adding the appropriate volume of water and) keeping all other volumes constant (1) (1) Allow H 2SO4 for H+ ions Allow concentration for volume If no other mark is scored Repeat experiment varying the volume of Br − varying the volume of Br −ion solution and keeping volume of BrO3- constant scores (1) (2) (Total for Question 3 = 17 marks) -----End of Page: 13-----

  4(d) An answer that makes reference to the following points:  reflux condenser sealed  direction of water flow in condenser is incorrect  conical flask should not be used (1) (1) (1) If additional errors are listed, mark these first Allow reflux condenser should be open (at top) Allow water should flow in through the bottom (and out through the top) Allow pear-shaped / round-bottom flask should be used Allow the answers as annotations on the diagram Do not award use of a thermometer (3)  4(e)  to react with / remove excess ethanoic anhydride Allow to dissolve excess ethanoic anhydride to dissolve / remove ethanoic acid to precipitate / crystallise the aspirin to improve yield of crystals Do not award quenches / stops the reaction Ignore just ‘to cool the mixture’ (1) -----End of Page: 16-----
