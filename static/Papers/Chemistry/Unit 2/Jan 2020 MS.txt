  11(c) The only correct answer is B (faster because the C-Br bond is weaker than the C-Cl bond) A is incorrect because the rate of the reaction depends on the bond strength rather than polarity C is incorrect because the rate is faster D is incorrect because the rate is faster 1 -----End of Page: 8-----
  12 (a) The only correct answer is B (112 ) A is incorrect because the volume of unreacted oxygen has been ignored C is incorrect because the volume of unreacted oxygen has been ignored and the water produced has been treated as steam D is incorrect because the water produced has been treated as steam 1  12(b) The only correct answer is B (1600) A is incorrect because the volume of unreacted oxygen has been ignored C is incorrect because the reaction of carbon dioxide with sodium hydroxide has been ignored and the volume of unreacted oxygen has also been ignored D is incorrect because the volume of unreacted oxygen has been ignored and the water produced has been treated as steam 1 -----End of Page: 9-----

  *16 (a) This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully-sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) In general, it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks and 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 mark for reasoning, and 0,1 or 2 indicative points would score zero marks for reasoning If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct mark(s) from the reasoning If no reasoning mark(s) awarded, do not deduct mark(s) 6 Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points 6 4 5–4 3 3–2 2 1 1 0 0 Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 -----End of Page: 18-----
