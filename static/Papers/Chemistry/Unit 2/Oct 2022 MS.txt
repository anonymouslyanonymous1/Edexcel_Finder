 *21(b) This question assesses the student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points 6 4 5-4 3 3-2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained lines of reasoning Answer shows a coherent logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, a response with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there were no linkages between the points, then the same indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks, and 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 mark for reasoning and 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would score zero marks for reasoning If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct mark(s) from the reasoning If no reasoning mark(s) awarded do not deduct mark(s) Comment: Look for the indicative marking points first, then consider the mark for the structure of the answer and sustained line of reasoning 6 -----End of Page: 16-----
