 Number *19(d) This question assesses the student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points 6 4 5-4 3 3-2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained lines of reasoning Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, a response with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there were no linkages between the points, then the same indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 reasoning mark 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would get zero reasoning marks (6) Expert -----End of Page: 21-----
 Answer shows a coherent logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 Indicative content IP1 iodine has (only) London forces/cannot form hydrogen bonds IP2 water molecules form hydrogen bonds (and London forces and permanent dipoles) IP3 hydrogen bonds are stronger than London forces/ the strongest (intermolecular force) IP4 hexane forms (only) London forces/cannot form hydrogen bonds IP5 London forces formed between iodine and hexane are similar (in strength) to those (broken) in hexane/ iodine (so iodine dissolves) If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct mark(s) from the reasoning If no reasoning mark(s) awarded do not deduct mark(s) Comment: Look for the indicative marking points first, then consider the mark for the structure of the answer and sustained line of reasoning Accept instantaneous/induced dipole/ IDID/dispersion/ van der Waals’ forces for London forces Allow London forces between iodine and hexane are greater than those between hexane -----End of Page: 22-----
 IP6 Iodine cannot form hydrogen bonds/ only forms weak London forces with water so the (hydrogen) bonds between water molecules cannot be broken (so iodine does not dissolve in water) Any reference to both hexane and iodine having permanent dipole interactions penalise in 1 IP only Any statement that hexane has more/stronger London forces than iodine is incorrect so loses 1 reasoning mark (Total for Question 19 = 15 marks)  -----End of Page: 23-----
