 *22(e)(i) This question assesses the student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured Answer with linkages and fully sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the Answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the Marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative Marking points seen in Answer Number of Marks awarded for indicative Marking points 6 4 5-4 3 3-2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the Marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Number of Marks awarded for structure of Answer and sustained lines of reasonin g Answer shows a coherent logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throu ghout 2 Guidance on how the Mark scheme should be applied The Mark for indicative content should be added to the Mark for lines of reasoning For example, a response with five indicative Marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 Marks (3 Marks for indicative content and 1 Mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there were no linkages between the points, then the same indicative Marking points would yield an overall score of 3 Marks (3 Marks for indicative content and no Marks for linkages) In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning Marks, and 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 Mark for reasoning, and 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would score zero Marks for reasoning If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct Mark(s) from the reasoning If no reasoning Mark(s) awarded do not deduct Mark(s) (6) -----End of Page: 24-----
Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasonin g 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructure d 0 Indicative content IP1 if temperature increases, rate increases (because more particles have energy greater than E a) IP2 if temperature increases, yield decreases (because forward reaction is exothermic/ reaction moves in the endothermic direction) IP3 if pressure increases, rate increases (because particles are more crowded and) collision frequency increases) IP4 if pressure increases, yield increases( as there are fewer particles on the RHS of the equation) IP5 the catalyst allows the use of lower temperature/less energy (for the same rate) IP6 high pressure (and temperature) are very expensive Allow reaction shifts to the left as an alternative to decreases yield Allow reaction shifts to the right as an alternative to increase yield Ignore fewer atoms on the RHS Ignore any reference to how the catalyst works and the effect of catalyst on rate and yield Allow conditions used are compromise between yield and cost / rate and cost Allow reverse argument for all points -----End of Page: 25-----
