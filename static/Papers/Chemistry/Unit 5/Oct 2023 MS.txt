 Question Number Acceptable Answers Additional Guidance Mark 20(a)(ii)* This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully - sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking Number of marks awarded for points seen in answer indicative marking points 6 4 5 – 4 3 3 – 2 2 1 1 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Comment: Look for the indicative marking points first, then consider the mark for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points that is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and line s of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) In general it would be expected that 5 or 6 indicative points would get 2 reasoning marks, and 3 or 4 indicative points would get 1 mark for reasoning, and 0, 1 or 2 indicative points would score zero marks for reasoning General points to note If there is any incorrect chemistry, deduct mark(s) fr om the reasoning If no reasoning mark(s) awarded do not deduct mark(s) Accept structures for names throughout If name and formula given both must be correct Deduct a reasoning mark if there is no comparison given for IP1 to IP3 Do not penalise unbalanced / incomplete equations Deduct (mark) from reasoning if any products given are incorrect (6) Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 -----End of Page: 22-----

  21(c)(i)  completed equation Example of equation: ⇌ Accept equation with H 2 O and H 3 O + Allow H 3 O + for H + on right hand side (1)  21(c)(ii) An explanation that makes reference to the following points:  acetylsalicylic acid will dissociate less in acidic solution or acetylsalicylic acid dissociate more in alkaline solution  because the additional H + / H 3 O + ions in the acid will shift the equilibrium position to the left  and OH − / hydroxide ions in the alkali will react with the H + ions and shift the equilibrium position to the right Penalise reference to change in K a once only (3) Allow reference to the stomach for ‘acidic solution’ (1) Allow reference to small intestine for ‘alkaline’ If both stated then both must be correct (1) Allow the backward reaction is favoured by the additional/higher H + / H 3 O + ions in the acid (1) Accept H + + OH − → H 2 O and this shifts the equilibrium position to the right Allow −COOH + OH − → −COO − + H 2 O Or carboxylic acid group reacts with /neutralises the OH − and this shifts the equilibrium position to the right/ favours the forward reaction -----End of Page: 30-----
  21(d)  methanol / CH 3 OH Allow displayed formula / combination of structural and displayed formula If name and formula are given then both must be correct Allow methyl alcohol Ignore reference to acid catalyst/ H 2 SO 4 / HCl/ heat Do not award methan a l Do not award CH 4 O (1)  21(e)  chemical shift ranges for OH and CH 3 in acetylsalicylic acid (1)  chemical shift ranges for OH and CH 3 in methyl salicylate (1) Example of table: Allow ranges in reverse order eg 120 – 100 Allow any range within these ranges 118 – 102 If no other mark is awarded, allow (1) for any two correct ranges If no other mark awarded, allow ( 1 ) for any three single values within the correct ranges or two single values with one acceptable range (2) Acetylsalicylic acid Methyl salicylate Type of proton OH CH 3 OH CH 3 Chemical shift / ppm 100 – 120 16 – 28 38 – 76 28 – 43 -----End of Page: 31-----
  21(f)  ( M1 ) calculation of mol NaOH added at (1) Example of calculation: mol NaOH = 250 × 100 = 0025 / 25 × 10 −2 (mol) (6) start 1000  ( M2 ) calculation of mol HCl used in titration (1) mol HCl = 1695 × 0100 = 0001695 / 1695 × 10 −3 (mol) 1000  ( M3 ) calculation of mol NaOH remaining in 250 cm 3 (1) (mol NaOH remaining in 250 cm 3 = 0001695 / 1695 × 10 −3 (mol)) mol NaOH remaining in 250 cm 3 = 001695 / 1695 × 10 −2 (mol)  ( M4 ) calculation of mol acetylsalicylic acid reacted (1) mol NaOH = 0025 – 001695 = 000805 / 805 × 10 −3 (mol) mol acetylsalicylic acid = 000805 = 0004025 2  ( M5 ) calculation of acetylsalicylic acid mass (1) mass acetylsalicylic acid = 0004025 × 180 = 07245 (g)  ( M6 ) calculation of percentage of percentage of acetylsalicylic acid = 07245 × 100 acetylsalicylic acid 0760 and = 95329 (%) deduction of Brand of tablet (1) and Brand B Allow TE at each stage Brand / percentage with no working scores (0) Ignore SF except 1 SF in the final mass calculated Ignore incorrect intermediate units Do not credit a division of moles by 2 if carried out before the subtraction -----End of Page: 32-----
