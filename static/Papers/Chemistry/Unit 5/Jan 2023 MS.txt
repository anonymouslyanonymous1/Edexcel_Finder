  2 0 ( e ) (i)  calculation of mol of KMnO 4 (1)  calculation of mol of C 6 H 5 CH 3 (1)  KMnO 4 is in excess because there are more than twice as many mol of KMnO 4 than mol of C 6 H 5 CH 3 (1) Example of calcul ation: Mol KMnO 4 = 700 = 00443 04 (mol) 158 Mol C 6 H 5 CH 3 = 173 = 00188 04 (mol) 92 Accept 00443 04 mol KMnO 4 would react with 00221 5 2 mol C 6 H 5 CH 3 or reverse argument TE on M1 and M2 Allow other methods eg Mol C 6 H 5 CH 3 = 173 = 00188 04 (mol) (1) 92 Minimum mass of KMnO 4 needed = 2 x 00188 04 x 158 = 5942 1 (g) (1) This is less than 7 g so KMnO 4 is in excess (1) Ignore SF except 1 SF in M1 and M2 ( 3 ) -----End of Page: 32-----
  2 0 ( e ) (ii)  add H + ions / acidify the solution / mixture Allow correct name or formula of any strong acid eg HCl, H 2 SO 4 , HNO 3 , H 3 PO 4 Do not award carboxylic acids eg CH 3 COOH Allow C 6 H 5 CO 2 – + H + → C 6 H 5 COOH Ignore references to concentration / heat / reflux Do not award ‘acid hydrolysis’ / acid catalyst / H + ions from water / inclusion of a second incorrect reagent eg H + and LiAlH 4 ( 1 )  2 0 ( f ) (i)  anode half - equation (1)  cathode half - equation (1) Examples of equations: Zn + 2OH − → ZnO + H 2 O + 2e − 2MnO 2 + H 2 O + 2e − → Mn 2 O 3 + 2OH − Allow multiples / reversible arrows Ignore state symbols even if incorrect If no other mark is awarded allow (1) for anode and cathode half - equations written in wrong places If no other mark awarded allow 1 mark for Zn on the left - hand side of the anode reaction and MnO 2 on the left - hand side of the cathode reaction (2 ) -----End of Page: 33-----
  2 0 ( f ) (ii)  ( E o = +)015 (V) Do not award – 015(V) ( 1 ) (Total for Question 2 0 = 1 9 marks) (Total for Section C = 19 marks) -----End of Page: 34-----
