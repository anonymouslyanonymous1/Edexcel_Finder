  1 The only correct answer is B because mass is unchanged for an antiparticle but charge is opposite A is not correct because anti-proton charge is negative C is not correct because mass cannot be negative D is not correct because mass cannot be negative 1 2 The only correct answer is C because this was one of the main conclusions A is not correct because this was a feature of the disproved plum pudding model B is not correct because the existence of protons and neutrons was not known at this time D is not correct because the conclusion was that most of the atom was empty space 1 3 The only correct answer is A because this is the correct description of thermionic emission B is not correct because this helps electrons to move freely when released C is not correct because the filament is not bombarded by high-energy electrons D is not correct because the metal filament is not maintained at a high potential 1 4 The only correct answer is B because the field lines diverge (indicating alike charges) and the point where a unit charge experiences no resultant force is closer to charge X A is not correct because the null point would be equidistant between the charges C is not correct because this would create a different (attractive) pattern between the charges D is not correct because this would create a different (attractive) pattern between the charges 1 5 The only correct answer is D because this uses the formula W = ½ QV and takes account of charge being measured in nC A is not correct because this gives capacitance of the capacitor in nF B is not correct because this uses an incorrect formula C is not correct because this does not take into consideration charge being measured in nC 1 6 The only correct answer is C because this is the only option expressed solely in base units A is not correct because the newton is not a base unit B is not correct because the newton and the coulomb are not base units D is not correct because the coulomb is not a base unit 1 7 The only correct answer is D because it gives the correct charge +2e A is not correct because the charge is −1e B is not correct because this is a meson C is not correct because this is a meson 1 8 The only correct answer is A as this is required for the operation of a Linac B is not correct because particles do not gain energy in the tubes C is not correct because the pd between tubes is the same for successive tubes D is not correct because the time spent in eachtube is the same 1 9 The only correct answer is B because m is proportional to p2 / E A is not correct because the mass is m C is not correct because the mass is m D is not correct because the mass is m 1 -----End of Page: 1-----
 10 The only correct answer is A because an alternating magnetic field is required to induce an alternating potential difference in M B is not correct because there is no changing magnetic field C is not correct because there would be an emf of constant polarity D is not correct because there would be an emf of constant polarity 1 -----End of Page: 2-----

  *14 This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully-sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points which is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) 6 -----End of Page: 6-----
 Indicative content: IC1: Change in flux linkage as magnet falls (through each tube) Or (magnetic) field lines cut the metal IC2: EMF induced (in each tube) IC3: Tube(s) made of conducting material, so there is a current Or Tube provides a closed circuit, so there is a current IC4: Magnetic field associated with this current IC5: Upward force exerted on magnet as the field is such to oppose the change that creates Or Due to Lenz’s law there is a force opposing the motion of the magnet IC6: Magnet takes less time to fall through Tube B because the slit reduces the number of paths for current in the conductor Total for question 14 6 -----End of Page: 7-----
