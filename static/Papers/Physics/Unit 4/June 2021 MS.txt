Question number Answer Mark 6 The only correct answer is D because this will decrease the rate of change of flux linkage and therefore the induced emf and therefore the current Incorrect answer A, B, C these will all increase the rate of change of flux linkage and therefore the induced emf and therefore the current (1) Question number Answer Mark 7 The only correct answer is B because each sphere has half of the original kinetic energy and if ke is decreased by a factor of ½, speed is decreased by the square root of this Incorrect answers A,C,D (1) Question number Answer Mark 8 The only correct answer is C because E = V/d so these changes decrease the electric field strength and therefore the force on the particle and therefore the acceleration and therefore the angle Incorrect answers A,B,D – these all increase the electric field strength (1) Question number Answer Mark 9 The only correct answer is B because F = Bqv so v=F/Bq Incorrect answers A,C,D (1) Question number Answer Mark 10 The only correct answer is D because short de Broglie wavelengths are needed to investigate the structure of nucleons at smaller scales Incorrect answers A these experiments are not about the creation of new particles B negative electrons do not experience repulsive electrostatic forces from positive protons or neutral neutrons C particle lifetime is not relevant as all of the particles involved are believed to be stable, as long as neutrons are in a nucleus (1) -----End of Page: 2-----

 Quest ion numb er Answer Mark *14 This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structured answer with linkages and fully-sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicative content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content Number of indicative marking points seen in answer Number of marks awarded for indicative marking points Max linkage mark available Max final mark 6 4 2 6 5 3 2 5 4 3 1 4 3 2 1 3 2 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 -----End of Page: 6-----
Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points which is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) Indicative content: • change of flux linked to surrounding metal Or change of flux linked to copper tube • emf induced • full conducting path available, so current in metal • current produces magnetic field • (by Lenz’s law the) magnetic field (due to the induced current) produces a force (on the magnet) that opposes the motion of magnet causing it • upward force on magnet, so (increased) downward force on tube 6 Total for question 14 6 -----End of Page: 7-----
