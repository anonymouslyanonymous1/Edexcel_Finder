 Question number Answer Mark 1 B The only correct answer is B because the components of the fields due to Y and Z along the direction of the line between Y and Z are equal and opposite and the component of the fields from each of Y and Z perpendicular to the line from Y to Z are both down the page, so the resultant is down the page A is not the correct answer because the components of the fields due to Y and Z along the direction of the line between Y and Z are equal and opposite and there is no resultant component in that direction C is not the correct answer because the components of the fields due to Y and Z along the direction of the line between Y and Z are equal and opposite and there is no resultant component in that direction D is not the correct answer because it is up the page (1) Question number Answer Mark 2 D The only correct answer is D because conservation of lepton number is violated because there should be an electron anti-neutrino rather than an electron neutrino A is not the correct answer because baryon number is conserved B is not the correct answer because charge is conserved C is not the correct answer because the equation does not give an indication of kinetic energy and the mass-energy for the products is not more than for the neutron (1) Question number Answer Mark 3 D The only correct answer is D because the charge stored on a capacitor = CV and all of the capacitors have the same pd of V, so doubling C doubles charge and having two capacitors doubles it again to 4Q A is not the correct answer because it is not 4Q B is not the correct answer because it is not 4Q C is not the correct answer because it is not 4Q (1) Question number Answer Mark 4 C (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
The only correct answer is C because all of the answers are dimensionally correct, but only C is in base units A is not the correct answer because C and V are not base units B is not the correct answer because C and J are not base units D is not the correct answer because C is not a base unit Question number Answer Mark 5 D The only correct answer is D because the component of momentum perpendicular to the surface is mvsinùúÉùúÉ so the change in momentum is 2mvsinùúÉùúÉ and the time is t and force = change in momentum divided by time A is not the correct answer because it does not take account of the angle B is not the correct answer because it does not take account of the angle C is not the correct answer because it is only half of the correct value (1) Question number Answer Mark -----End of Page: 2-----
6 C The only correct answer is C because E = V/d and F = Eq and W = mg, so Vq/d = mg A is not the correct answer because it is not mgd/V B is not the correct answer because it is not mgd/V D is not the correct answer because it is not mgd/V (1) Question number Answer Mark 7 C The only correct answer is C because the force is into the page A is not the correct answer because it is in the plane of the page B is not the correct answer because it is in the plane of the page D is not the correct answer because it is out of the page (1) Question number Answer Mark 8 C The only correct answer is C because doubling one charge doubles force, so doubling both charges increases the force by a factor of 4, and doubling the distance decreases the force by a factor of 4, so the force is unchanged A is not the correct answer because the force is changed B is not the correct answer because the force is changed D is not the correct answer because the force is changed (1) Question number Answer Mark 9 C The only correct answer is C because angular velocity = angular displacement / time, which is 33 revolutions multiplied by 2 œÄ radians divided by 60 seconds A is not the correct answer because it is not 33 √ó 2 œÄ / 60 B is not the correct answer because it is not 33 √ó 2 œÄ / 60 D is not the correct answer because it is not 33 √ó 2 œÄ / 60 (1) Question number Answer Mark 10 A The only correct answer is A because at X, by Lenz‚Äôs law, the force produced by the current will oppose the change creating it, so it will create a north-seeking pole to produce an upward force on the north-seeking pole of magnet and at Y it will create a north seeking pole to produce an upward force on the south seeking pole of the magnet (1) -----End of Page: 3-----
 B is not the correct answer because the pole at Y is south C is not the correct answer because the pole at X is north D is not the correct answer because the poles at both X and Y are south Question number Answer Mark 11 ‚Ä¢ Use of F = BIl ‚Ä¢ Use of moment = Fx ‚Ä¢ Applies component = Fcos20¬∞ or Fsin70¬∞ ‚Ä¢ Moments = 79 √ó 10‚àí3 N m Example of equation F = 007 T √ó 69 A √ó 005 m √ó 10 = 024 N Moment = 2 √ó 024 N √ó sin70¬∞ √ó (0035 m)/2 = 79 √ó 10‚àí3 N m 1 1 1 1 (4) Total for question 11 4 Question number Answer Mark 12 (a) annihilation 1 (1) 12 (b) ‚Ä¢ Use of ŒîE = c2 Œîm ‚Ä¢ Use E = hf ‚Ä¢ Use of c = fŒª ‚Ä¢ Œª = 24 √ó 10‚àí12 m Example of equation ŒîE = (300 √ó 108 m s‚àí1)2 √ó 2 √ó 911 √ó 10‚àí31 kg f = 164 √ó 10‚àí13 J / 663 √ó 10‚àí34 J s √ó 2 Œª = 300 √ó 108 m s‚àí1 / 124 √ó 1020 Hz Œª = 242 √ó 10‚àí12 m 1 1 1 1 (4) Total for question 12 5 -----End of Page: 4-----

 Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points which is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) Indicative content: ‚Ä¢ (Aternating pd produces) alternating current in input coil ‚Ä¢ (Alternating/varying current produces) a varying magnetic field in core Or (Alternating/varying current produces) a varying magnetic field in second coil ‚Ä¢ There is a change in magnetic flux linkage with (second) coil ‚Ä¢ Emf induced ‚Ä¢ Complete circuit, so current in capacitor circuit ‚Ä¢ Diode produces direct current Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 15(b)(ii) ‚Ä¢ Evidence of attempt to determine maximum gradient of graph ‚Ä¢ Use of emf = NA dB/dt ‚Ä¢ Max emf = 610 V Example of calculation Gradient = 1030 T s‚àí1 Emf = 1030 T s‚àí1 √ó 1700 √ó 35 √ó 10‚àí4 m2 = 613 V (1) (1) (1) 3 15 (c) ‚Ä¢ Calculate V0 / e ‚Ä¢ Read time constant from graph = (45 s) ‚Ä¢ Use of time constant = RC ‚Ä¢ Use of W = ¬Ω CV2 ‚Ä¢ W = 270 J which is greater than 047 J, so the electrical method stores the most energy OR ‚Ä¢ Draws tangent to line at t = 0 s (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 5 -----End of Page: 8-----
