  1 B is the correct answer (A path difference of λ would cause constructive interference A is not the correct answer as this path difference would cause destructive interference C is not the correct answer as this phase difference would cause neither constructive nor destructive interference D is not the correct answer as this phase difference would cause destructive interference (1) 2 D is the correct answer (Polarised waves have oscillations in one direction and perpendicular to the direction of wave travel) A is not the correct answer as the single plane of polarisation includes the direction of wave travel and is not perpendicular to it B is not the correct answer as polarised waves do not contain many plames C is not the correct answer as polarised waves do not contain many directions (1) 3 D is the correct answer (Total resistance in series is 10Ω and 25Ω in parallel) A is not the correct answer as the two resistances are the wrong way around B is not the correct answer as this assumes the formulae for series and parallel resistors are the same C is not the correct answer as this assumes the formulae for series and parallel resistors are the same (1) 4 A is the correct answer (Both points X and Y represent positions on the graph where there is infinite resistance as the current is zero) B is not the correct answer as there is a non-infinite resistance at Z C is not the correct answer as there is also infinite resistance at Y D is not the correct answer as there is a non-infinite resistance at Z (1) 5 D is the correct answer (Drift velocity is I/nqA) A is not the correct answer as drift velocity is not I/nA B is not the correct answer as drift velocity is not nqA/I C is not the correct answer as drift velocity is not nA/I (1) 6 B is the correct answer (hf = Φ + KEmax so increasing f increases KEmax) A is not the correct answer as electrons are released instantaneously C is not the correct answer as increasing intensity only increases the number of electrons released and each electron still has the same kinetic energy D is not the correct answer as it is higher frequency, not wavelength, that eventually passes a threshold value to release electrons (1) 7 A is the correct answer (Reading on V1 decreases, readings on V2 and A increase) B is not the correct answer as the decreased resistance of the thermistor will lead to a greater share of the pd across the fixed resistor C is not the correct answer as the meter readings show what would happen if the temperature decreased D is not the correct answer as none of the three meter readings would change in the ways stated (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
 8 C is the correct answer (Both transverse and longitudinal waves can be refracted) A is not the correct answer as it is only electromagnetic waves that travel at the same speed in a vacuum – there are other transverse waves which travel at different speeds B is not the correct answer as transverse waves have vibrations that are perpendicular to the direction of wave travel D is not the correct answer as light is a transverse wave that can travel through liquids (1) 9 C is the correct answer (The diffraction grating is set up so that it is parallel to the screen) A is not the correct answer as θ is calculated by taking measurements of diffraction grating to screen distance and the distance between bright dots then using trigonometry B is not the correct answer as the diffraction grating should be perpendicular to the laser light beam D is not the correct answer as the distance between the bright dots is best measured using a metre rule (1) 10 A is the correct answer (Evidence for the wave nature of electrons came from experiments involving diffraction) B is not the correct answer C is not the correct answer D is not the correct answer (1) -----End of Page: 2-----
