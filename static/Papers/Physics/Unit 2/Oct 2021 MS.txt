 7 C is the correct answer as the path difference of 12cm is half the wavelength, causing destructive interference (no heating) A is not the correct answer as the path difference of 12cm would only cause maximum heating if it was a multiple of the wavelength B is not the correct answer as the path difference of 12cm would only cause maximum heating if it was a multiple of the wavelength D is not the correct answer as the path difference of 12cm would only cause no heating if it was an odd half multiple of the wavelength (1) 8 B is the correct answer as, for a uniform wire, the ratio of distances AS:SB is the same as the ratio R1:R2, and distance AS = y, distance SB = x−y A is not the correct answer as x is not the distance SB C is not the correct answer as y is not the distance SB D is not the correct answer as the ratio x/y is equivalent to the ratio (R1+R2)/R1 (1) 9 B is the correct answer as λ is much smaller than the gap size A is not the correct answer as λ matches the gap size C is not the correct answer as λ is larger than the gap size D is not the correct answer as λ matches the gap size (1) 10 D is the correct answer as Z is a full cycle from V, and compressions are separated by one full wave cycle A is not the correct answer as W is neither a compression nor a rarefaction B is not the correct answer as X is a rarefaction C is not the correct answer as Y is neither a compression nor a rarefaction (1) -----End of Page: 2-----
  11a Use of n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2 Use of n = c/v with c = 300 × 108 (m s−1) v = 14 × 108 (m s−1) so material is cubic zirconia (For MP1, allow use of n = sin i / sin r) (All marks can be achieved if candidate calculates n for all of the gemstones and compares to value calculated in MP1) Example of calculation n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2, 100 sin (50°) = n2 sin (21°), n2 = 214 n = c/v , so v = (300 × 108 m s−1) / 214 = 14 × 108 m s−1 (1) (1) (1) 3 11bi Use of sin C = 1/ n where n = c/v Critical angle for diamond is 24° (405° > 24°) so diagram shows reflection at the boundary Ray completed showing TIR in correct direction by eye OR Use of n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2 n1sinθ1 = 157 (sin θ2 > 1) so diagram shows reflection at the boundary Ray completed showing TIR in correct direction by eye (Only allow MP3 if TIR is drawn on the diagram, not just stated) Example of calculation sin C = 1/ n = (124 × 108 ms−1) / (300 × 108 ms−1) = 041 C = sin−1 (041) = 24° (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 11bii Silicon carbide has a greater refractive index (than diamond) Or silicon carbide has a smaller critical angle (than diamond) Or critical angle for silicon carbide is 23° Or critical angle is still less than the angle of incidence Or sin θ2 is still > 1 So total internal reflection (TIR) would (still) take place (MP2 dependent on MP1) (Calculation of n for silicon carbide not good enough for MP1) (1) (1) 2 Total for question 11 9 -----End of Page: 3-----
  12(a) Waves have been reflected by the water surface Transmitted wave and reflected wave interfere Or waves travelling in opposite directions interfere (For MP2, allow ‘superpose’ for ‘interfere’) (For MP2, do not allow ‘opposite waves’) (1) (1) 2 12(b)(i) Use of v = fλ With λ = 4 × length of column (or see 0772m) v = 340 ms−1 Example of calculation λ = 4 × length of column = 4 × 0193 m = 0772 m v = fλ = 440 Hz × 0772 m = 3397 ms−1 (1) (1) (1) 3 12(b)(ii) (Wave)length would be longer Or node to antinode distance would be longer This would cause the value (for the speed of sound) to be higher (than calculated value, which is therefore less accurate) (MP2 dependent on MP1) (Answer can be written in the converse eg the wavelength used in the calculation is shorter, so the calculated speed is lower) (1) (1) 2 Total for Question 12 7 -----End of Page: 4-----

  14a (In the wave model) energy is built up over time Or (in the wave model) the energy is spread across the wave So (photo)electrons would not be released immediately/instantaneously Or so (photo)electrons would be released after a time delay (MP1 – allow any wording indicating a time delay eg ‘slowly’) (MP2 – do not allow “photoelectric emission” unless it is directly linked to electron release) (1) (1) 2 14bi Use of hf = Φ + ½mv2max Converts from eV to J Use of Ek = ½mv2 (with m = 911 × 10−31) Maximum speed of electrons = 73 × 105 ms−1 Example of calculation Φ (in J) = 43 eV × (16 × 10−19 J eV−1) = 69 × 10−19 J hf − Φ = ½mv2 = (93 × 10−19 J) – (69 × 10−19 J) = 24 × 10−19 J 24 × 10−19 J = ½ (911 × 10−31 kg) v2 v = 73 × 105 ms−1 (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 14bii Lower work function (than zinc) would result in greater (maximum) speed (of electrons) Greater wavelength (of ultraviolet light) would result in smaller (maximum) speed (of electrons) Or to achieve greater (maximum) speed (of electrons), a smaller wavelength would be required The relative sizes of these changes are not known so no conclusion could be reached Or the first suggestion is correct, the second is incorrect (MP1/MP2 – ignore references to KE) (1) (1) (1) 3 Total for question 14 9 -----End of Page: 6-----

  *16a This question assesses a student’s ability to show a coherent and logically structure answer with linkages and fully sustained reasoning Marks are awarded for indicat content and for how the answer is structured and shows lines of reasoning The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for indicative content The following table shows how the marks should be awarded for structure and lines of reasoning Indicative content • Atoms/electrons absorb energy/photons • Electrons move to higher energy levels • Then drop down energy levels, releasing photons • Energy levels are discrete • For hydrogen atoms, there are only a small number of possible energy level differences (that can occur to produce visible light) • Since E = hf and v = fλ, only certain wavelengths are emitted (For IC1, do not allow ‘gain energy’) (For IC2 and IC3, allow electrons excited and de-excited) (IC4, allow ‘atoms only have certain/specific energy levels’) IC points IC mark Max linkage mark Max final mark 6 4 2 6 5 3 2 5 4 3 1 4 3 2 1 3 2 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 Number of marks awarded for structure of answer and sustained line of reasoning Answer shows a coherent and logical structure with linkages and fully sustained lines of reasoning demonstrated throughout 2 Answer is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning 1 Answer has no linkages between points and is unstructured 0 6 16b Air contains different gases/molecules/elements/atoms Each (different) gas has its own energy levels (so light with a large number of wavelengths/frequencies are released) (MP1 – do not accept ‘air is a mixture of different particles’) (1) (1) 2 Total for question 16 8 -----End of Page: 8-----
