 Question Number Answer 1 A is the correct answer B is not correct because the light would refract towards the normal C is not correct because the light moves into a material with a greater refractive index D is not correct because the light would not be transmitted along the normal 2 C is the correct answer A is not correct because the number of conduction electrons should increase B is not correct because the number of conduction electrons should increase and the resistance should decrease D is not correct because the resistance should decrease 3 A is the correct answer B is not correct because this would give the momentum of the electron C is not correct because this gives 1 velocity D is not correct because this would give 1 momentum for the electron 4 C is the correct answer A is not correct because this describes an energy of 1 J B is not correct because this describes a current of 1 A D is not correct because this describes a charge of 1 C 5 D is the correct answer A is not correct because 015 (A) is the current in the 10 Ω resistor B is not correct because 050 V is the potential difference across the 5 Ω resistor when the switch is open C is not correct because 100 V is the potential difference across the 10 Ω resistor when the switch is open 6 C is the correct answer A is not correct because the line should start at the origin B is not correct because the line should start at the origin and should not cross the x- axis D is not correct because the gradient should be positive 7 D is the correct answer A is not correct because this gives the time period of the wave B is not correct because this gives half the time period of the wave C is not correct because the denominator is half the time period -----End of Page: 1-----
