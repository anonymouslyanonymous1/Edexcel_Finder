  1 A is the correct answer as diffraction is the spreading of waves as they pass an object B is not the correct answer as interference is not the spreading of waves C is not the correct answer as reflection is not the spreading of waves D is not the correct answer as refraction is not the spreading of waves (1) 2 B is the correct answer as decreasing the time period increases the frequency (f = 1/T) A is not the correct answer as amplitude is unaffected by time period C is not the correct answer as speed is affected by both time period and wavelength D is not the correct answer as wavelength is affected by both time period and speed (1) 3 A is the correct answer as frequency is unchanged when travelling into a different medium B is not the correct answer as some of the light intensity becomes the reflected light C is not the correct answer as the speed decreases when travelling into a more optically-dense substance D is not the correct answer as the wavelength decreases when travelling into a more optically-dense substance (1) 4 C is the correct answer as the pd across a uniform wire is directly proportional to its length A is not the correct answer as this does not show a directly proportional relationship B is not the correct answer as this does not show a directly proportional relationship D is not the correct answer as this does not show a directly proportional relationship (1) 5 D is the correct answer as v = 𝒉 𝝀𝒎 A is not the correct answer as v is not equal to 𝑚 ℎ𝜆 B is not the correct answer as v is not equal to 𝜆𝑚 ℎ C is not the correct answer as v is not equal to ℎ𝜆 𝑚 (1) 6 C is the correct answer as the path difference of 15λ is equivalent to a phase difference of π radians A is not the correct answer as 0 radians would mean that the path difference was 0, λ, 2λ etc B is not the correct answer as π/2 radians would mean that the path difference was 025λ, 125λ etc D is not the correct answer as 3π/2 radians would mean that the path difference was 075λ, 175λ etc (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
 7 D is the correct answer as coherence can only occur if the waves have the same frequency A is not the correct answer as coherence does not require waves to be in antiphase, they just need a constant phase difference B is not the correct answer as coherence does not require waves to be in phase, they just need a constant phase difference C is not the correct answer as waves can still be coherent, even if their amplitudes are different (1) 8 D is the correct answer as decreasing the distance between the central maximum and the first order maximum would require sinθ to be reduced (presuming that the distance from the diffraction grating to the screen is unchanged), and λ = 𝒅 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝜽 𝒏 A is not the correct answer as this does not affect sinθ B is not the correct answer as this would increase the distance between the central maximum and first order maximum C is not the correct answer as more lines per mm would make d smaller, so as d = 𝑛𝜆 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 , which would make sinθ increas (1) 9 A is the correct answer The power of the Sun is constant, so IA is constant for all the planets IE x 4π (149 × 1011 m)2 = IJ × 4π (778 × 1011m)2 B is not the correct answer as 4π cancels in the equation C is not the correct answer as the radius of orbit has not been squared D is not the correct answer as 4π cancels in the equation and the radius of the orbit has not been squared (1) 10 A is the correct answer as decreased temperature results in a decrease in lattice vibrations B is not the correct answer as this would only happen if the temperature increased C is not the correct answer as a filament is not a semiconductor D is not the correct answer as a filament is not a semiconductor (1) -----End of Page: 2-----
