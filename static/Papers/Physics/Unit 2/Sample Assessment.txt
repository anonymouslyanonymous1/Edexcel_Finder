Question number Answer Mark 19(c) Continued Indicative content  For the yo-yo to accelerate with the train there must be a horizontal force acting on it  A horizontal force on the yo-yo is provided by the horizontal component of the tension in the string  The string could never be completely vertical because there must be a horizontal force  The yo-yo has a weight so there always has to be a vertical force acting on it  The tension in the string provides the vertical component of force  The string could never be completely horizontal because there must be a vertical force Guidance on how the mark scheme should be applied: The mark for indicative content should be added to the mark for lines of reasoning For example, an answer with five indicative marking points, which is partially structured with some linkages and lines of reasoning, scores 4 marks (3 marks for indicative content and 1 mark for partial structure and some linkages and lines of reasoning) If there are no linkages between points, the same five indicative marking points would yield an overall score of 3 marks (3 marks for indicative content and no marks for linkages) Total for Question 19 12 Centre Number Candidate Number Write your name here Surname Other names Total Marks Paper Reference *S58681A0124*S58681A ©2018 Pearson Education Ltd 1/1/1/1/1/ Turn over Instructions • Use black ink or black ball-point pen • Fill in the boxes at the top of this page with your name, centre number and candidate number • Answer all questions • Answer the questions in the spaces provided – there may be more space than you need • Show all your working out in calculations and include units where appropriate Information • The total mark for this paper is 80 • The marks for each question are shown in brackets – use this as a guide as to how much time to spend on each question • In questions marked with an asterisk (*), marks will be awarded for your ability to structure your answer logically, showing how the points that you make are related or follow on from each other where appropriate Advice • Read each question carefully before you start to answer it • Try to answer every question • Check your answers if you have time at the end Physics International Advanced Subsidiary/Advanced Level Unit 2: Waves and Electricity Sample Assessment Materials for first teaching September 2018 Time: 1 hour 30 minutes WPH12/01 Y ou must have: Scientific calculator, Ruler Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Level 39 Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary/Advanced Level in Physics Sample Assessment Materials – Issue 1 – September 2017 © Pearson Education Limited 2017-----End of Page: 0-----
