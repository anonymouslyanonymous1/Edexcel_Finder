  1ai Use a water bath and measure temperature of water Use ice to bring water down to 0 °C (1) (1) 2 1aii Minimise the time between removing ball from the water bath and dropping it Because the ball changes temperature as soon as it is removed from the water bath OR Keep the ball in the water for sufficient time So that ball is at same temperature as the water OR Stir the water To ensure the water is all at the same temperature (ai and aii to be marked holistically) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 2 1b Keep ball near to the metre rule View bounce height perpendicular to the metre rule Measure to the bottom of the ball Use a video camera [Scrutiny comment: the bottom of the ball should be in line with the zero on the metre rule when the ball is released?] (1) (1) (1) (1) Max 2 1c Hot water can cause burns Handle ball with tongs Or wear safety glasses to prevent splashes to eyes Or Clamp beaker to avoid knocking it over when ball removed quickly (1) (1) 2 1d Max two from: No unit for temperature Temperature does not start at zero Mean not given to consistent significant figures Only mean bounce height recorded (1) (1) (1) (1) 2 1e There is a linear relationship (But) it is not proportional Or the line does not pass through the origin Or best fit line drawn that does not pass through origin (1) (1) 2 1fi Zero error (allow systematic error) (1) 1 1fii Subtract 21 °C from all readings (1) 1 Total for question 14 -----End of Page: 1-----
  2a Measure x using a second metre rule Ensure second metre rule is vertical using a set square (allow spirit level or plumb line instead of set square, Or align with door or window frame) Use set square (between second metre rule and loaded metre rule) to reduce parallax error (1) (1) (1) 3 2b Micrometer or vernier callipers Repeat and calculate a mean Take readings at different places along the metre rule (1) (1) (1) 3 2ci Mean x = 278 (mm) Use of half range Or maximum difference from the mean %U = 2 % (1 or 2 sf) Example Calculation Mean x = (272+276+279+283)/4 = 278 mm %U = (55 / 278) × 100 = 20 % (1) (1) (1) 3 2cii Use of 𝐸 = 4𝑙3𝑊 𝑥𝑤𝑡3 E = 114 × 1010 (Pa) (ecf from ci) Use of 4% of given value of E E is above upper limit so student’s results do not agree (allow method using 2% uncertainty in value of x) Example Calculation E = (4 × (0800 m)3 × 580 N) / (0278 m × 300 ×10-2 m × (500 × 10-3 m)3) E = 114 × 1010 (Pa) 108 × 109 Pa × 104 = 112 × 1010 Pa (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 Total for question 13 -----End of Page: 2-----
  3a Compares 𝐸k = ℎ𝑓 − 𝜙 to y=mx+c (may be implicit) Identifies h as gradient [or m] and states this is constant (1) (1) 2 3b y-axis labelled Ek / 10-19 J and x-axis labelled f / 10-15 Hz Sensible scales Plotting Line of best fit (1) (1) (2) (1) 5 3c 𝜙 in range 46 × 10-19 J to 50 × 10-19 J Large triangle for gradient h in range 65 – 67 Js Example Calculation 𝜙 found from y axis intercept Gradient = 136 × 10-19 J / (275 × 10−15 – 070 × 10−15) = 66 x 10-34 Hz h = gradient = 66 x 10-34 Js (1) (1) (1) 3 Total for question 10 -----End of Page: 3-----
  4ai Vernier reading = 334 cm s = 008 cm Example Calculation 334 cm – 326 cm = 008 cm (1) (1) 2 4aii Uncertainty = 001 cm Percentage uncertainty = 13 % (allow ecf from ai) Example Calculation Uncertainty = 2 × 0005 cm = 001 cm Percentage uncertainty = 001 008 × 100 = 13 % (1) (1) 2 4bi There is a whole number of wavelengths path difference between the light arriving from the two different slits / sources So the waves arrive at the screen in phase (1) (1) 2 4bii Uncertainty in locating the centres of the bands is constant Measuring a larger distance decreases the percentage error (1) (1) 2 4ci Use of 𝑤 = 𝜆𝐷 𝑠 with w = 60 5 mm λ = 67 × 10-7 m Example Calculation 𝑤 = 60 5 = 12 mm 𝜆 = 0012 m × 30 × 10−4 m 54 m = 667 × 10−7 m (1) (1) 2 4cii %UD = 019 % %Uw = 17 % %Us is the largest value so s is most significant Example Calculation %UD = (001 m / 54 m) ×100 = 019 % %Uw = (1 mm / 60 mm) × 100 = 17 % 32 % > 17 % and 019 % (1) (1) (1) 3 Total for question 13 -----End of Page: 4-----
