2 *P65751A0220* Answer ALL questions 1 A student investigated the conservation of momentum using the apparatus as shown glider B glider Alight gate light gate cardair track (a) The air track provides a cushion of air which reduces friction between the gliders and the track Describe how the student would show that the air track is horizontal before starting the investigation (1)    -----End of Page: 1-----
3 *P65751A0320* Turn over (b) The student pushed glider A The first light gate recorded the time t1 for the card on glider A to pass through it The gliders collided and stuck together  The second light gate recorded the time t2 for the card on glider A to pass through it The student recorded t1 and t2 for three separate collisions t1 / s 034 021 028 t2 / s 070 039 055 The masses of the gliders were identical If momentum is conserved then t2 = 2t1 Show that moment um was conserved in this investigation (3)       (c) Another student suggested that using a piece of card twice as long would improve the investigation Assess this suggestion (3)       (Total for Question 1 = 7 marks)-----End of Page: 2-----
4 *P65751A0420* 2 A student wrote the following plan to investigate the distance travelled by alpha particles in air  Place the Geiger-Müller tube in front of the source Measure the distance d from the source to the tube Measure the count Change d and take more readings Devise a more detailed plan for this investigation                (Total for Question 2 = 6 marks)-----End of Page: 3-----
6 *P65751A0620* 3 A bar magnet was suspended from a wooden retort stand as shown retort stand bar magnet The magnet lined up with the magnetic field of the Earth The magnet was given a small angular displacement from its equilibrium position and oscillated in a horizontal plane about the string as shown (a) Describe how the time period of these oscillat ions should be measured to make the readings as accurate as possible (3)      -----End of Page: 4-----
