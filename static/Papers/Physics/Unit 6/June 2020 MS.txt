 Question number Answer Mark 1(a) Gently push the glider and check that the times to go through each light gate are similar Or Put a glider on the track and check it remains stationary Or Use a rule and/or set square to check the height of the track is the same in two places Or Use a spirit level to check the bubble is central [accept any valid safe alternative practical method] (1) (1) (1) (1) 1 1(b) Use of t2 = 2t1 Three correct calculations shown Conclusion consistent with calculation Example of calculation 070/034 = 206 039/021 = 186 055/028 = 196 As all values are approximately equal to 2 then momentum was conserved (1) (1) (1) 3 1(c) (If the card is twice as long) the time should double The resolution of the timer is constant Or the uncertainty is constant So the percentage uncertainty for the time will halve , improving the investigation (1) (1) (1) 3 Total mark for Question 1 = 7 -----End of Page: 1-----
