  1 A is the correct answer B is not correct as both the micro and centi columns are incorrect C is not correct as the micro column is incorrect D is not correct as the centi column is incorrect (1) 2 B is the correct answer A is not correct as they are the units for force C is not correct as they are the units for momentum D is not correct as they are the units for power (1) 3 C is the correct answer A is not correct as diameter is being used for radius B is not correct as diameter is being used for radius D is not correct as the anomalous point (136) has not been ignored (1) 4 D is the correct answer This is because the area under a stress-strain graph is the work done per unit volume, but the area under the other 3 graphs represents work done (1) 5 B is the correct answer This is because the horizontal component is calculated using the equation 𝑣𝑣H = �𝑣𝑣2−𝑣𝑣V 2 = √052 −032 = 04 (1) 6 C is the correct answer This is because Wc should have been drawn in the centre of the cube (1) 7 C is the correct answer A is not correct as it ignores the weight of the table B is a correct equation since Rc=Wc, but it is not an instance of the third law D is a correct equation but it is not an instance of the third law (1) 8 C is the correct answer This is because the power needed is equal to the gravitational energy supplied per second (mgh) plus the kinetic energy given to the water per second (½mv2) (1) 9 C is the correct answer This is because s=½gt2 So if in one unit of time the sphere has fallen one unit of distance, ie from image 1 to image 2, then in 2 units of time it will have fallen 4 units of distance, ie from image 1 to R (1) 10 B is the correct answer This is because the force is given by F=kx So if k is doubled but x remains the same, F will be doubled (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
