  1 The only correct answer is D because kg m−3 is the unit for density (scalar) A is not the correct answer as m s−1 is the unit for velocity (vector) and speed (scalar) B is not the correct answer as m s−2 is the unit for acceleration (vector) C is not the correct answer as kg m s−2 is the unit for force (vector) (1) 2 The only correct answer is C as the velocity is changing (due to the direction changing) and N2 describes a resultant force (due to the gravitational force of the earth) causing a change in velocity A is not the correct answer as the velocity is changing B is not the correct answer as the velocity is changing and N2 describes a changing velocity due to unbalanced forces D is not the correct answer as N2 describes a changing velocity due to unbalanced forces (1) 3 The only correct answer is B because Upthrust is equal to weight of sphere (25 N) Weight of displaced water if half sphere submerged = 25 N Weight of displaced water if all of sphere submerged = 50 N Total upwards force acting on sphere when completely submerged = 50 N Total downwards force on sphere if completely submerged (and stationary) = 50 N F must be equal to 25 N A is not the correct answer as F = 25 N C is not the correct answer as F = 25 N D is not the correct answer as F = 25 N (1) 4 The only correct answer is B as s = vt and s = 12 × 09 A is not the correct answer as s = vt and s = 12 × 09 C is not the correct answer as s = vt and s = 12 × 09 D is not the correct answer as s = vt and s = 12 × 09 (1) 5 The only correct answer is D A is not the correct answer as smaller particles of sand have a lower terminal velocity so take longer to reach the bottom of the beaker B is not the correct answer as a lower temperature would increase the viscosity and increase the time taken for the particles to reach the bottom of the beaker (lower terminal velocity) C is not the correct answer as the sand particles take longer to reach the bottom of the beaker with a smaller terminal velocity (1) 6 The only correct answer is C A is not the correct answer as it has a high elastic limit B is not the correct answer as it has a high elastic limit and a small region of plastic deformation D is not the correct answer as it has a small region of plastic deformation (1) -----End of Page: 1-----

  11 Max 4 • Initial momentum (of the child, ball and skateboard/total) is zero • Due to conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the ball is thrown = total momentum after the ball is thrown (so final total momentum is zero) • The momentum of the child/skateboard is equal to the momentum of the ball • The momentum of the child/skateboard is opposite in direction to the momentum of the ball • As the mass of the child/skateboard greater (than the mass of ball), the velocity (of the child/skateboard) will be lower (all symbols to be defined, ‘mv’ to be defined if used for momentum) (MP3 accept to the right/positive for forwards) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 Total for question 11 4 -----End of Page: 3-----
