  1 The correct answer is C A is not the correct answer because displacement is a vector B is not the correct answer because the moment of a force has a magnitude and a direction so is therefore a vector D is not the correct answer because weight is a force, and force is a vector 1 2 The correct answer is A B is not the correct answer because it should be weight, not acceleration C is not the correct answer because it should be weight, not gravitational potential energy D is not the correct answer because it should be weight, not acceleration and mass, not weight 1 3 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because gpe should be added not subtracted on the right hand side C is not the correct answer because the total elastic energy is not FΔx and gpe should be added not subtracted on the right hand side D is not the correct answer because the total elastic energy is not FΔx 1 4 The correct answer is D A is not the correct answer because the drop speed would be too slow if the flow were laminar B is not the correct answer because the ball bearing should not be moving at terminal velocity at all C is not the correct answer because to calculate g you must know the initial velocity and the student isn't measuring that 1 5 The correct answer is C A is not the correct answer because the acceleration is not 5 m s−2 B is not the correct answer because the acceleration is not 981 m s−2 D is not the correct answer because this expression is not dimensionally correct and the acceleration is not 981 m s−2 1 6 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because the diagram gives the force required for balance C is not the correct answer because the diagram gives (W – U) − P D is not the correct answer because the diagram gives P − (W – U) 1 7 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because the acceleration is not positive C is not the correct answer because the acceleration does not increase D is not the correct answer because the acceleration does not decrease 1 -----End of Page: 1-----
 8 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because the mass has not been multiplied by g C is not the correct answer because the mass has not been multiplied by g and the factor of 103 is missing for the power D is not the correct answer because the factor of 103 is missing for the power 1 9 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because the mass is not needed C is not the correct answer because radius cannot be directly measured and the mass is not needed D is not the correct answer because radius cannot be directly measured 1 10 The correct answer is B A is not the correct answer because the forces don't act on the same body C is not the correct answer because the forces have equal magnitudes D in not the correct answer because the forces have equal magnitudes 1  11 Use of s = u t + ½ a t2 with u = 0 and a = g for flight time Use of s = u t + ½ a t2 with a = 0 for horizontal displacement of stone Distance travelled = 59 m Example of calculation 12 m = 05 × 981 m s−2 × t2 t = √(120 m ÷ 4905 m s−2) = 156 s sstone = 38 m s−1 × 156 s = 594 m (1) (1) (1) 3 Total for question 11 3  12(a) (Use balance to measure) mass and multiply mass by g to determine weight Or Use the balance set to read newtons to determine weight (of ball) Measure the diameter (of the ball) (with the calliper) to determine volume Identify upthrust with weight of fluid displaced Calculate the weight of fluid displaced by multiplying the volume of the ball by the density of the liquid and g (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 12(b) Use of F = 6π ηrv η = 22 × 102 Pa s Example of calculation 11 × 10−2 N = 6π × η × 050 × 10−2 m × 54 × 10−4 m s−1 η = 11 × 10−2 N ÷ (6π × 27 × 10−6 m2 s−1) = 216 Pa s (1) (1) 2 Total for question 12 6 -----End of Page: 2-----
