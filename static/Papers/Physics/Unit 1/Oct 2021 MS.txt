Questio n Number Answer Mark 1 B is the correct answer A is incorrect because gradient is velocity, not acceleration C is incorrect because gradient is rate of change of acceleration, not velocity D is incorrect because gradient is rate of change of acceleration, not displacement 1 2 C is the correct answer A is incorrect because magnitudes are equal B is incorrect because magnitudes are equal and directions are opposite D is incorrect because directions are opposite 1 3 C is the correct answer A is incorrect because reducing the extension reduces the stored energy B is incorrect because reducing the extension reduces the stored energy and increasing the force increases the stored energy D isincorrect because increasing the force increases the stored energy 1 4 C is the correct answer A is incorrect because 132/answer = cos 226°, not sin 226° B is incorrect because 132/answer = cos 226°, not sin 226°, and the equation has slo been incorrectly transposed D is incorrect because although 55/answer = sin 226° the equation has been incorrectly transposed 1 5 B is the correct answer A is incorrect because the CW moment of the force could balance the ACW moment of the weight C is incorrect because the CW moment of the force could balance the ACW moment of the weight D is incorrect because the CW moment of the force could balance the ACW moment of the weight 1 -----End of Page: 1-----
6 A is the correct answer B is incorrect because N is in the wrong direction C is incorrect because the wrong diagonal has been used D is incorrect because the wrong diagonal has been used 1 7 A is the correct answer B is incorrect because the distance has not been doubled and the time has not been squared C is incorrect because the distance is in the wrong unit D is incorrect because the distance is in the wrong unit, has not been doubled and the time has not been squared 1 8 B is the correct answer A is incorrect because the factor 981 = g / (N kg−1) is not needed since it is already included in the weight, ΔEgrav = mgΔh = WΔh C is incorrect because dividing by 981 removes g from the calculation D is incorrect because dividing by 981 removes g and the factor 25 = Δh / m is missing from the calculation 1 9 A is the correct answer B is incorrect because low viscosity is not a condition C is incorrect because cylindrical object is not a condition D is incorrect because neither cylindrical object nor low viscosity are conditions 1 10 D is the correct answer A is incorrect because mg has the wrong direction B is incorrect because mg and ma have the wrong directions C is incorrect because ma has the wrong direction 1 Total for Section A 10 -----End of Page: 2-----
