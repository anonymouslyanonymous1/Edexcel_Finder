 SECTION A  1 A is the only correct answer B is incorrect because final displacement is measured from 0, not −1 C is incorrect because displacement is not the area between the line and the t axis, and velocity is 3 m ÷ 6 s, not 6 m ÷ 3 s D in incorrect because velocity is 3 m ÷ 6 s, not 6 m ÷ 3 s 1 2 D is the only correct answer A is not the correct answer because mass is a scalar and force and acceleration are vectors B is not the correct answer because force is a vector C is not the correct answer because mass is a scalar and acceleration is a vector 1 3 A is the only correct answer B is incorrect because the velocity is always zero C is incorrect because the velocity is always positive D in incorrect because velocity is zero except for a very short time 1 4 C is the only correct answer A is incorrect because the magnitude is the sum of the squares not the difference B is incorrect because the magnitude is the sum of the squares not the difference and a tangent is required for the angle, not a sine D is incorrect because a tangent is required for the angle, not a sine 1 5 C is the only correct answer A is incorrect because the 2 should be above the line, and the 063 should be squared B is incorrect because the 2 should be above the line D is incorrect because he 063 should be squared 1 6 B is the only correct answer A is incorrect because a greater viscosity would reduce terminal velocity giving a lower gradient C is incorrect because because a greater viscosity would reduce terminal velocity giving a lower gradient D is incorrect because because a greater viscosity would reduce terminal velocity giving a lower gradient 1 7 B is the only correct answer A is incorrect because force P and R act on the same object C is incorrect because force Q and S act on the same object D is incorrect because forces P and S are not the same type of force 1 8 A is the only correct answer B is incorrect because doubling the diameter gives four times the cross section, requiring four times the tension for the same stress C is incorrect because increasing the diameter increases the cross section, requiring a greater tension for the same stress, not less D is incorrect because increasing the diameter increases the cross section, requiring a greater tension for the same stress, not less 1 9 C is the only correct answer A is incorrect because moments must balance about the centre of mass B is incorrect because moments must balance about the left support D is incorrect because the total reaction must be equal to the weight 1 10 B is the only correct answer A is incorrect because one watt is defined as one joule per second C is incorrect because a 1 N = 1 kg m s−2 D is incorrect because a joule is the unit for work, and work = force × distance 1 Total for Section A 10 -----End of Page: 1-----
