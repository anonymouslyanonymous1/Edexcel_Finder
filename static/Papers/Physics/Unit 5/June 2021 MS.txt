  1 D is the correct answer A is not the correct answer as the background is already included in the count B is not the correct answer as the background will still add a systematic error C is not the correct answer as the background will still add a systematic error (1) 2 B is the correct answer A is not the correct answer as H0 does not give the size of the universe C is not the correct answer as 1/H0 gives the age of the universe D is not the correct answer as H0 does not give the size of the universe (1) 3 D is the correct answer A is not the correct answer as damping occurs at all frequencies B is not the correct answer as energy is transferred at all frequencies C is not the correct answer as energy is dissipated at all frequencies (1) 4 D is the correct answer A is not the correct answer as helium is not being fused in the Sun B is not the correct answer as fusion doesn’t require a large number of H nuclei C is not the correct answer as fusion does not require a large mass of H (1) 5 B is the correct answer as 𝑔 = 𝐺𝑀 𝑟2 and 𝑀 ∝ 𝜌 (as both have the same volume) (1) 6 A is the correct answer B is not the correct answer as this would have a much lower temperature than the Sun C is not the correct answer as this would have a much higher luminosity than the Sun D is not the correct answer as this would have a much lower luminosity than the Sun (1) 7 C is the correct answer A is not the correct answer as mean square velocity increases as the gas is heated B is not the correct answer as 𝑝 ∝ 𝑇, so T quadruples when p quadruples D is not the correct answer as 𝑝 ∝ 𝑇, so T quadruples when p quadruples (1) 8 D is the correct answer as 𝐿 = 𝜎𝐴𝑇4, so 𝐿 ∝ 𝑇4 (as both have the same radius) (1) 9 B is the correct answer as 𝑣max = 𝜔𝐴 and 𝜔 = 2π 𝑇 , so 𝑣max = ( 2π 𝑇 ) × 𝐴 (1) 10 A is the correct answer B is not the correct answer as λmax is less for X, so surface temperature is higher C is not the correct answer as the max intensity of X (hence luminosity) is higher D is not the correct answer as the max intensity of X (hence luminosity) is higher and λmax for X is less, so surface temperature must be higher (1) -----End of Page: 1-----
