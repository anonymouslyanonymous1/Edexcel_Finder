  13 MAX 4 The student is correct to say that the rate of decay decreases over time However, the uranium doesn’t become more stable, the number of unstable uranium nuclei decreases The student should have said that radiation is emitted from the nucleus [accept atom] The student was wrong to say that the particles emitted are radioactive Because the emitted particles do not decay In a time equal to the half-life the number of unstable nuclei (and not the mass) decreases by 50% Because the product nuclei are nearly as massive as the unstable nuclei (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 4 Total for question 13 4 -----End of Page: 4-----
