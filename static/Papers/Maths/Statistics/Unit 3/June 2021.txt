*P63153A0220* 2 1 A plant biologist claims that as the percentage moisture content of the soil in a field increases, so does the percentage plant coverage He splits the field into equal areas labelled A, B, C, D and E and measures the percentage plant coverage and the percentage moisture content for each area The results are shown in the table below A B C D E Coverage % 10 12 25 0 6 Moisture % 30 20 40 10 25 (a) Calcu late Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for these data (5) (b) Statin g your hypotheses clearly, test at the 5% level of significance, whether or not these data provide support for the plant biologist’s claim (4)                       -----End of Page: 1-----
