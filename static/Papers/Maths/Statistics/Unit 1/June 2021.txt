*P63150A01820* 18 Leave blank 6 Two economics students, Andi and Behrouz, are studying some data relating to unemployment, x %, and increase in wages, y %, for a European country The least squares regression line of y on x has equation y = 3684 − 03242x and ∑ y = 237 ∑ y 2 = 4263 ∑ x 2 = 75681 n = 16 (a) Show that Syy = 7524 375 (1) (b) Find Sxx (4) (c) Find the product moment correlation coefficient between x and y (3) Behrouz claims that, assuming the model is valid, the data show that when unemployment is 2% wages increase at over 3% (d) Explain how Behrouz could have come to this conclusion (1) Andi uses the formula range = mean ± 3 × standard deviation to estimate the range of values for x (e) Find estimates of the minimum value and the maximum value of x in these data using Andi’s formula (3) (f) Comment, giving a reason, on the reliability of Behrouz’s claim (2) Andi suggests using the regression line with equation y = 3684 – 03242x to estimate unemployment when wages are increasing at 2% (g) Comment, giving a reason, on Andi’s suggestion (2)       -----End of Page: 17-----
