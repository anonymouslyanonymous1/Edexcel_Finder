Notes (i) B1: Shows the result is true for n = 1 The LHS may just be stated, for the RHS accept as a minimum either one unsimplified term or the 30 seen (Conclusion not needed here if both sides have been found correctly) M1: Attempts 1 51 41 k + −  either way round using the result for n = k A1: Correct unsimplified matrix The coefficients inside may be simplified but the common factor 3 not taken out directly A1: Achieves this result with no errors, via 1 6 15 3 33 12 12 6 3 k kk kk − + − −  + − + or 2 5 13 4 4 2 1 k kk kk + − −  + − + (oe with simplified linear terms) A1cso: Suitable conclusion following fully correct work Must include in some form the points “true for n =1”, “true for n = k implies true for n = k + 1” and conclude true for all n in the conclusion Depends on the preceding MAA marks and at least stating the correct matrix for n = 1in the initial base case check (So B0M1A1A1A1 is possible) (ii) B1: Shows the result is true for n = 1, Must express as a multiple of 7 or clearly show the factor M1: Attempts f(k + 1) dM1: Attempts to express f (k + 1) in terms of f (k) Note they may let f(k) = 7m where m is an integer and use this in the working A1: Correct expression for f (k + 1) in terms of f (k) (or m) A1cso: Suitable conclusion following fully correct work Must include in some form the points “true for n =1”, “true for n = k implies true for n = k + 1” and conclude true for all n in the conclusion Depends on the preceding MdMA marks and finding at least f(1) = 518 (So B0M1dM1A1A1 is possible if all that is missing is showing the factor 7 in f(1)) (ii) Alt B1: Shows the result is true for n = 1 Must express as a multiple of 7 or clearly show the factor M1: Attempt f (k +1) – Mf (k) for any integer M If M = 0 this is the main scheme M = 1 may be seen frequently, but other value are possible dM1: Attempts to express f (k +1) – Mf (k) in terms of f (k) or otherwise show a common factor of 7 A1: Correct expression for f (k +1) – Mf (k) in terms of f (k) or with clear common factor of 7 shown Note if M = 1 is used, the expression becomes ( )2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 6 83386 9 5657 k k k k+ − + − = ++  which is fine for dM1A1 A1cso: Refers to divisibility of f (k +1) and makes suitable conclusion following fully correct work Must include in some form the points “true for n =1”, “true for n = k implies true for n = k + 1” and conclude true for all n in the working Depends on the preceding MdMA marks and finding at least f(1) = 518 (So B0M1dM1A1A1 is possible if all that is missing is showing the factor 7 in f(1)) -----End of Page: 14-----
