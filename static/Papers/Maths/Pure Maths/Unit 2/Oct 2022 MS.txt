 Note that in most cases the M1 can only follow B1 but there may be some exceptions Numerical approach using the table: B1: Any one correct row for b = 1, b = 2 or b = 3 Products do not need to be found for this mark M1: Attempts the product abc for at least 2 valid combinations A1*: Requires: • All three valid combinations with correct products • No other combinations shown unless they are crossed out or eg have a cross at the end of the row or are discounted in some way • A (minimal) conclusion eg the product of a, b and c is even, hence proven, QED, hence it is even, each product stated as even, etc Algebraic/logic approach: B1: Uses the information to obtain a correct equation connecting a and b eg a + 2b = 8, a = 8 − 2b M1: States a must be even and considers the product abc in some way A1*: States eg abc is even with a reason eg “even  anything is even” Pure Algebraic approach: B1: Uses the information to obtain a correct equation connecting a and b eg a + 2b = 8, a = 8 − 2b M1: ( ) ( )8 2 2abc b b b= − + Attempts the product of a, b and c in terms of b (or some other letter) A1*: ( ) ( )2 4 2abc b b b= − + which is even, hence proven, QED etc Concludes abc is even and makes a (minimal) conclusion There must be no algebraic errors NB using this approach “ 322 4 16abc b b b=− + + which is even hence proven” is not sufficient – they would need to say eg which is even + even + even or factor out the 2 Question Number Scheme Marks 1 a b c (abc) 6 1 3 (18) 4 2 4 (32) 2 3 5 (30) Any one correct row for b = 1, b = 2 or b = 3 Products do not need to be found for this mark B1 Attempts the product abc for at least 2 valid combinations M1 Finds all three valid combinations with correct products seen and somewhere/shows why this is exhaustive and concludes * A1* (3 marks) -----End of Page: 1-----
