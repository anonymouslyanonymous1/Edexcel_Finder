 Proof by induction for part (a): ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 ar nS a r − = ⇒= = − so true for n = 1 Assume true for n = k so ( )1 1 k k ar S r − = − Add (k + 1)th term ( ) 1 1 1 1 11 k kkk k k ar ar ar arS arrr + + − −+−= +=−− ( ) 11 1 11 kk ara ar rr ++ −−= = −− So if true for n = k it has been shown true for n = k + 1 and as it is true for n = 1 it is true for (for all n) Mark as follows: M1: Shows true for n = 1 and assumes true for n = k and adds the (k + 1)th term A1(M1 on EPEN): Finds common denominator obtains 1 1 ka ar r +− − using correct algebra A1: Fully correct proof reaching ( ) 11 1 kar r +− − with all steps shown and conclusion If you are in any doubt about awarding marks in this case or any other cases that you think deserve credit, send to your Team Leader using Review -----End of Page: 13-----
