 B1: Sets up algebraically the initial statement to be contradicted Essentially for showing they know what a rational number is algebraically There is no requirement for this mark to state that p and q are integers with no (non-trivial) common factors (this may be implied for this mark) M1: Cubes correctly and multiplies through by q3 A1: Deduces that both p3 is a multiple of 3 and hence p is a multiple of 3 Jumping directly to p is a multiple of 3 is A0 dM1: Sets 3pk= and proceeds to find q3 in terms of k (May use a different letter) A1: Completes the proof This requires • Correct algebraic statements • Correct deductions in correct order Eg p3 is a multiple of 3 so p is a multiple of 3 • initial statement must have included that p and q are integers (or accept natural numbers or a p q is a fraction) and have no common factors (or are co-prime, or in simplest form) • correct reason for contradiction and acceptable conclusion • There must have been no contrary statements during the proof (eg that p and q are prime) -----End of Page: 20-----
