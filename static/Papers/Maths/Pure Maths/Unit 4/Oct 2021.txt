*P69198A03436* 34 Leave blank 10 (a) A studentʼs attempt to answer the question ‟Prove by contradiction that if n3 is even, then n is even” is shown below  Line 5 of the proof is missing Assume that there exists a number n such that n 3 is even, but n is odd If n is odd then n = 2 p + 1 where p ∈  So n3 = (2 p + 1)3 = 8 p3 + 12 p2 + 6 p + 1 = This contradicts our initial assumption, so if n 3 is even, then n is even Complete this proof by filling in line 5 (1) (b) Hence, prove by contradiction that 23 is irrational (5)                   -----End of Page: 33-----
