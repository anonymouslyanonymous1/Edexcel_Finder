 (c) B1 May be tackled in a variety of ways Requires a reason and a conclusion Eg • States that the upper limit (or maximum value) is 450 so cannot reach 500 Note that it is acceptable to state that the number of toads cannot exceed 449 (Allow here 450N < for upper limit is 450) • The conclusion can be implied by a statement such as ''as the maximum value is 450'' • Alternatively substitutes 012 012 012 900e500 100e 500 2e 1 t t t = ⇒= − + or similar and states this cannot be found as ln's cannot be taken of negative numbers, hence cannot ever be 500 (Allow the candidate to state maths error, exponentials cannot be negative to form part of their reason) The calculations here must be correct and the proof complete The following 3 examples score B0 as they are incomplete and/or incorrect 1) 012 012 012 900e500 e 5 2e 1 t t t = ⇒= − + which cannot be found (Requires a conclusion) 2) The limit is 450 so they cannot reach 500 (Requires upper limit) 3) 012 012 012 900e500 e 001 2e 1 t t t = ⇒= − + which cannot be found and so they cannot reach 500 (Requires correct calculation) -----End of Page: 2-----
