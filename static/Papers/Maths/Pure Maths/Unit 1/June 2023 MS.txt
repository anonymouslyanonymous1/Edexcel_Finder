Question 8 – General Guidance for marking Note that some candidates are misreading the 1 2x − as 1 2x in part (a) and/or part (b) In the majority of cases it will be clear if this is the case as candidates often write down the expression before they differentiate in part (a) or integrate in part (b) If it is clear that a candidate thinks the expression is 1 3 21 84 xx− in either or both parts then FULL marks should be awarded for correct work – details are below We are condoning the fact that does not lie on If candidates do not write down the original expression (in (a) or (b)) then evidence of misreading or not can be taken from their derivative or integral (4,12)P 1 3 21 84y x x=− Note: If candidates integrate in (a) and differentiate in (b) then the maximum marks available are: (a) M0A0M1dM1A0 (b) M0A0dM0A0 If parts are not labelled then you should assume that the first attempt is part (a) and the second attempt is part (b) -----End of Page: 13-----
