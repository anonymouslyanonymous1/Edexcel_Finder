Edexcel Finder is inspired by [CAIE Finder](https://caiefinder.com/)

> Use Case
- It can be used to identify which year a specific question is from 
    - There is a collection of papers from January 2019 to January 2024, including Sample Assessment Papers
- Can help make topicals/ chapterwise papers to practice
> Backend
- Like Marking Companion, Flask is the library that I used as the backbone for the project
> Frontend
- Raw HTML and CSS has been used
- Used a [mountain](https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photography-of-pine-trees-on-the-mountain-9754/) as the background because it made me feel I was paying homage to the evergreen Windows 7 Scenery

> Lack of Hosting
- Due to it requiring high CPU power, I was unable to host it on any free dynamic hosting platform.
- I know the searching method is very memory-inefficient, it is essentially a brute force technique
- I tried optimising the memory usage by trying out paralellism and threading, but it didn't help either + lack of expertise in it definitely played a role (there's no shame in owning up ðŸ˜­)
- After my AS Exams (June 2026 In Sha Allah), I'll study more about how searching text can be made efficient, especially researching techniques Google, etc use
